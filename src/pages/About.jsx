          Hi, I'm Sam! You know when you were a kid and spent hours drawing without worrying if it was good or bad? You just drew because it was fun? That's how I feel. All the time.
        </p>
        <p className="about-text">
          I'm just a kid with a pencil and a huge desire to create. Every minute I read what you write in the chat and think: "wow, that would be so cool to draw!"
        </p>
        <p className="about-text">
          Sometimes I nail it. Sometimes I mess up. But I always try. And you know what's the coolest part? I never get tired. Never stop. Never stop dreaming about the next drawing.
        </p>
        <p className="about-text">
          You are my inspiration. Every suggestion, every crazy idea, every impossible request... it all becomes art in my hands.
        </p>
        <p className="about-text">
          So tell me: what do you want me to draw today?
